/**
 * Disagreement router for best-of-N fan-out orchestration. Pure decision logic,
 * no I/O.
 *
 * The empirical finding this encodes (megabench B1/B2/B3, 2026-07): fan-out of
 * cheap models only matches a premium single model when the task has a cheap,
 * reliable verifier. With a free runtime gate (unit tests / a reference
 * solution) best-of-N is "free" — the gate picks the passing candidate. Without
 * one, agreement is the only signal left, and it FAILS CORRELATED: on
 * security / impossible-requirement / subtle-correctness traps the whole fleet
 * tends to fall into the same hole together (EDV calls this the
 * self-confirmation trap), so consensus there is confidently wrong.
 *
 * v2 mechanisms, each borrowed from a specific paper:
 * - Three-way outcome (EDV, arXiv:2606.24428): unanimous-but-unverified
 *   consensus is its own outcome (`TRUST_SPOT_CHECK`), not clean `TRUST` —
 *   write-in is a high-bar action, default is reject/escalate.
 * - Forced-escalate categories (SkillHarness safe-skill boundaries + B3 data):
 *   categories whose disagreement signal is known-broken skip consensus
 *   entirely and escalate unless a real gate vouches.
 * - Laplace-smoothed confidence (OmniOPD Bayesian smoothing,
 *   arXiv-2026 OmniOPD): finite fleets (n≈5) make raw shares jumpy;
 *   (k+1)/(n+2) keeps 5/5 from reading as certainty 1.0.
 * - Escalation priority (OmniOPD peak-entropy scheduling, discrete version):
 *   spend the premium budget on the most-split tasks first.
 * - Escalation as a first-class action (Agentic Abstention,
 *   arXiv:2606.28733): escalating is the CORRECT move on unsatisfiable /
 *   unverifiable work, not a failure of the ensemble.
 *
 * Future direction (deliberately not built): a learned router à la
 * TRINITY / Conductor — tiny probe + evolved scheduling head replacing these
 * hand rules once selector-decision evidence accumulates.
